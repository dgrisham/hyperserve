# hyperserve

A http server framework for Jai that’s very much *NOT DONE YET*.
It’s mostly a place to fool around with HTTP stuff until I have enough pieces together to turn it into a proper framework.

It aspires to become someting similar to [hapi](https://hapi.dev) but without all the Node.js nonsense.
